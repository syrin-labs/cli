## From Zero to Production-Ready

Each guide is self-contained. Pick the one that matches what you want to do.

## Guides

### [Quick Test Without Config](/guides/quick-test-without-config/)

Inspect, analyse, or test-connect to any MCP server without creating a project or config files. Zero setup required.

### [Interactive Dev Session](/guides/interactive-dev-session/)

Use `syrin dev` to see exactly what your LLM proposes when it interacts with your MCP server. Step through tool calls one at a time.

### [Test Your MCP Tools](/guides/test-your-mcp-tools/)

Write tool contracts, run sandboxed tests, and catch side effects, output explosions, and schema mismatches before production.

### [Add Syrin to CI](/guides/add-syrin-to-ci/)

Run `syrin analyse` and `syrin test` in your CI pipeline. Catch regressions on every pull request.
