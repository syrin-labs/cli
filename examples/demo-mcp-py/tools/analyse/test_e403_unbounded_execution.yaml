# Tool contract for test_e403_unbounded_execution
# Tests E403: Unbounded Execution - tool execution times out

version: 1
tool: test_e403_unbounded_execution

contract:
  input_schema: TestE016Input
  output_schema: TestE016Output

guarantees:
  side_effects: none
  max_output_size: '1kb'
  max_execution_time: '5s' # Declared timeout: 5 seconds (reduced for faster testing)

tests:
  # Test: Should detect timeout (E403)
  # E403 is automatically detected when tool execution exceeds declared timeout
  - name: test_unbounded_execution_detection
    input:
      data: 'test'
    expect:
      error:
        type: unbounded_execution # Expected: Unbounded execution timeout error
    # Tool sleeps for 6s, exceeding declared timeout (5s)
    # E403 should trigger showing: "exceeded declared timeout: 5s"
    # Behavioral rules detect timeouts automatically
    # Note: This test will timeout, which is expected behavior
